# Sum square difference

## Problem

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is

\[ 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385 . \]

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is

\[ (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025 . \]

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is \( 3025 - 385 = 2640 \).

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.


## Methodology

<!-- \[ Δ(n) = \left( ∑_{i=1}^n i \right)^2 - ∑_{i=1}^n i^2 = \left( \frac12 n (n+1) \right)^2 - \frac16 n (n + 1) (2n + 1) = \frac{1}{12} n (n + 1) (3 n^2 - n - 2) . \] -->

\begin{align*}
Δ(n)  & =  \left( ∑_{i=1}^n i \right)^2 - ∑_{i=1}^n i^2  \\
    & =  \left( \frac12 n (n+1) \right)^2 - \frac16 n (n + 1) (2n + 1)  \\
    & = \frac{1}{12} n (n + 1) (3 n^2 - n - 2)  .  \\
\end{align*}


## Solution

We simply have \( Δ(100) = 25164150 \).
