Motivation \u00b6 One of my goals is to make my solutions to these problems accessible to everyone, and also to open my solutions to scrutiny by others. I hope they help you as much as they have helped me. If you find a bug or error in the explanation, please contact me. Thank you! Philosophy \u00b6 I have tried to explain the solution to each problem before giving the code. In particular, if I have tried to derive mathematically closed form solutions as much as possible. Most of the problems are still incomplete, and many of them will have suboptimal solutions. My quest is to reduce that number. Most problem pages have the following sections. Problem : the problem as stated. Methodology : The idea behind the solution. Code : The actual code. Solution : The final result. I recommend the iterative strategy if you are having a hard time with a problem. Give a quick read at the methodology and see if anything strikes you. Ponder over it and try to solve the problem again. If not come back and try to delve deeper. You should look at the code as a last resort. Thanks \u00b6 This website is designed using the following.

For example, 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2 . There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000 a + b + c = 1000 . Find the product abc abc . Methodology \u00b6 Let p p be the given perimeter of the triangle.

Using the fact that a + b + c = p a + b + c = p , we get 2 m (m + n) = p 2 m (m + n) = p . Now we need good bounds for m, n m, n in order to reduce the search space.
